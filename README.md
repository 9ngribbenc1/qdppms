This directory contains scripts for controlling experiments on a Quantum Design
Dynacool PPMS with external custom electronics. Scripts here were designed to be 
run on a different computer than the one with MultiVu that directly controls the
PPMS. The computer this script runs on must have a direct ethernet connection to
the MultiVu PPMS computer, and this computer must have direct communication, ie
GPIB, with the external custom electronics.
